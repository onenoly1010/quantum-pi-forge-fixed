**Established:** December 31, 2025  
**Authority:** OINIO - Sovereign Architect & Cantor  
**Scope:** All Quantum Pi Forge | OINIO Ecosystem Services

---

## 🌐 THE CANONICAL PLATFORM

**There is ONE official front door for the Quantum Pi Forge ecosystem:**

### **👉 https://quantum-pi-forge-fixed.vercel.app/**

This is the **sole canonical URL** for:
- ✅ Gasless OINIO staking dashboard
- ✅ Wallet connection & authentication
- ✅ Leaderboard rankings
- ✅ User onboarding & documentation
- ✅ API integrations (`/api/sponsor-transaction`, `/api/health`, `/api/leaderboard`)
- ✅ All ecosystem service links

---

## 🚫 DEPRECATED & NON-CANONICAL

The following URLs are **deprecated** and must NOT be used as primary references:

### ❌ `quantumpiforge.com`
- **Status:** Deprecated marketing site (GitHub Pages)
- **Action:** Will display redirect notice to canonical Vercel app
- **Reason:** Dual platforms create confusion; Vercel is the live operational platform

### ❌ `onenoly1010.github.io/quantum-pi-forge-site/`
- **Status:** Deprecated (same as quantumpiforge.com)
- **Action:** Redirect to canonical platform

### ❌ `docs.quantumpiforge.com`
- **Status:** Never operational (DNS misconfiguration)
- **Action:** Archived
