# 🎮 QMIX 3-Agent Theorem Visualization

**Interactive demonstration of the QMIX theorem for multi-agent reinforcement learning.**

## 🎯 Core Insight

> **Monotonic mixing preserves individual argmax alignment with joint Q_tot argmax.**

This enables **Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE)**.

## 📐 The QMIX Formula

```
Q_tot(u) = w₁·Q₁(u₁) + w₂·Q₂(u₂) + w₃·Q₃(u₃) + b
```

**Theorem**: If all weights w_i ≥ 0 (monotonic), then:

```
argmax_u Q_tot(u) = (argmax Q₁, argmax Q₂, argmax Q₃)
```

## 🔧 Features

- **Interactive Q-value sliders**: Adjust individual agent Q-functions
- **Mixer weight control**: Test monotonicity by setting weights negative
- **Real-time visualization**: See Q_tot for all 8 joint action combinations
- **Theorem verification**: Automatic check if greedy = global argmax
- **Swap analysis**: Demonstrate monotonic improvement property

## 💡 Try This

1. Keep all weights positive → Theorem holds ✅
2. Set one weight negative → Watch the theorem break ❌
3. Observe which joint action becomes optimal

## 📚 What is QMIX?

QMIX (Rashid et al., 2018) is a value decomposition method for cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning:

1. **Factored Q-values**: Each agent maintains its own Q-function
2. **Monotonic Mixing**: Q_tot is a monotonic combination of individual Qs
3. **Decentralized Execution**: Agents act greedily on local information
4. **Centralized Training**: Global Q_tot used for backpropagation
