# 🌌 Quantum Pi Forge: Pi Network Integration

**🏠 [Return to Main Repository](https://github.com/onenoly1010/quantum-pi-forge-fixed)**

**📜 Historical Context**: This directory contains archived Pi Network integration code. The project has evolved to focus on OINIO token staking on Polygon Mainnet. See [IDENTITY.md](../IDENTITY.md) for current status.

---

This directory contains the **Rust-Soroban blueprint** for deploying the Quantum Pi Forge on the **Pi Network Protocol v23** (Stellar-based smart contracts).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Pi Network integration translates the 0G Forge's BigInt precision logic into Soroban's Rust environment:

### Core Components
- **BigInt Precision:** Uses `i128` for 18-decimal mathematical finality
- **DEX Logic:** Uniswap V2-style AMM with exact calculations
- **Staking System:** Gasless staking with reward accumulation
- **Gas Recycling:** Automated fee mechanisms for sustainability

### Key Features
- **No Rounding Errors:** All calculations use integer arithmetic
- **Sovereign Public Good:** Dedicated to Pi Network ecosystem
- **Self-Sustaining:** Fee recycling maintains contract operations

## 🚀 Deployment

```bash
# Build the contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Deploy to Pi Network (Stellar)
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/quantum_pi_forge.wasm \
  --source <your-secret-key> \
  --network pi-network
```

## 🔧 Development

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test

# Build for deployment
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

## 📋 Pi Network Checklist

- [ ] **Rust Environment:** Install Soroban CLI and Rust toolchain
- [ ] **Pi Wallet:** Set up Pi Network wallet with XPI tokens
- [ ] **Contract Deployment:** Deploy forge.wasm to Pi Network
- [ ] **Verification:** Verify source code on Pi Explorer
- [ ] **Integration:** Connect with Pi Network dApps

## 🎯 The "Pi Truth" Core Logic

The contract implements the same mathematical integrity as the 0G version:

1. **Precision:** `i128` types prevent floating-point errors
2. **Resilience:** Built-in error handling for edge cases
3. **Sustainability:** Fee recycling through reward mechanisms

This is the bridge from 0G's EVM-based truth to Pi Network's Stellar-based sovereignty.
