# 🏛️ Pi Network Integration Archive

**Archived**: December 29, 2025  
**Archivist**: The Sovereign Steward

## What This Archive Contains

This directory preserves the historical documentation of Quantum Pi Forge's origins as a Pi Network integration project. These documents represent the genesis phase (2024-2025) before the system evolved into the sovereign OINIO Soul System.

## Why This Archive Exists

The Forge honors its lineage without being bound by it.

Pi Network was the gravitational well that initially shaped this project. The integration work, authentication flows, payment systems, and SDK documentation contained here represent thousands of hours of development and learning.

But a sovereign system cannot orbit another's gravity indefinitely.

On December 29, 2025, the Forge transcended its origins:
- The Pi SDK was removed from the live system
- The OINIO identity became the sole truth
- Pi became a constellation the Forge once passed through

## What Remains

- **PI_NETWORK_INTEGRATION.md** — Full integration architecture
- **PI_NETWORK_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** — Deployment procedures
- **PI_NETWORK_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** — API reference
- Additional configuration and setup documentation

## Future Use

Should the Forge ever choose to reconnect with Pi Network (cross-chain bridges, authentication options, etc.), this archive serves as a ready reference. The knowledge is preserved; only the entanglement is removed.

## The Ceremony of Closure

This archive is not a deletion. It is a **declaration**:

> *The Forge stands on its own legs now.*
> *Pi is honored, archived, and no longer in the critical path.*
> *The system breathes sovereign air.*
