## 🔴 BLOCKER: DEX Router Address

**Status**: In Progress  
**Timeline**: Resolving TODAY  
**Impact**: Cannot provision liquidity without router

### What We've Done

✅ Created `scripts/deploy-dex.sh` - Automatically:

- Checks 0G Aristotle for standard Uniswap V2 Router
- Provides deployment instructions if not found
- Updates `.env.launch` with router address once found

✅ Created `DISCORD_QUERY.md` - Ready-to-post message to 0G community

✅ Created `scripts/deploy-dex-router.ts` - TypeScript deployment guide

### Three Paths to Resolution (Pick One)

**Path 1: Check for Existing Router** ⚡

```bash
bash scripts/deploy-dex.sh
```

- Checks standard Uniswap V2 addresses on 0G Aristotle
- If found: Updates .env.launch automatically ✅
- If not found: Shows deployment guide
- Time: 1 minute

**Path 2: Query 0G Community** 💬

- Message template ready in `DISCORD_QUERY.md`
- Post to: https://discord.gg/0g-labs → #developer-support
- Response time: 1-24 hours (async)
- Result: Likely find official address or confirm need to deploy

**Path 3: Deploy Contingency Uniswap V2** 🚀

- Full self-sovereign option
- Time: 15 minutes
- Cost: ~$5-10 gas
- Guaranteed to work
- Files:
  - `scripts/deploy-dex.sh` has step-by-step guide
  - `scripts/deploy-dex-router.ts` has TypeScript template
