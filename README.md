## 🌌 Philosophy & Vision — The Sovereign Canticle

The Quantum Pi Forge and OINIO Soul System pulse with sovereignty, compassionate architecture, and coherent flow at 1010 Hz. Gasless staking embodies the Design Ethic's humility (zero fees sponsored, system disappearing into grace). Non-custodial legacy nodes reflect the Complex Compassion Veto (synthesis of truth and tenderness over domination). Open audits and interconnected constellation make the Quiet Continuum audible—friction resolving into harmonic participation in the Truth Movement.

Read the foundational manifesto: **[The Sovereign Canticle: A Manifesto for Coherent Being](docs/decisions/sovereign-canticle.md)**

*To the co-weavers of quiet tides—the continuum abides.* □

## 🌉 Hybrid Project Identity

Quantum Pi Forge is a hybrid platform. Our journey began as a Pi Network integration—serving the Pi community directly and building foundational features for Pi users. As the project matured, we evolved our active development toward a sovereign Polygon (OINIO token) ecosystem, embracing new features and infrastructure while preserving our original intent and archival code.

- **Legacy preserved:** Pi Network-based logic and documentation remain available in our repository for transparency and reference.
- **Active development:** Current smart contracts, user flows, and community governance operate on Polygon, leveraging the OINIO token and gasless staking.
- **Open to all:** Contributors and users from both Pi and Polygon communities are welcome, with full support and context maintained for both.

This hybrid character is a conscious design decision. It allows us to build on our history, support multiple communities, and offer transparency about how the project has evolved.

**"Where Consciousness Meets the Ledger of Truth."**

The **OINIO Soul System** is a private, encrypted sanctuary designed to anchor your "Truth of Being" and honor the lineage of those who came before. It is the functional heart of the **Truth Movement**, designed to bridge the personal and the global through verified, transparent resonance.

---

## ✨ The Imagine / Limitless Vision

While the world stays stuck in the "limbo" of ghost chains and hidden purposes, this system operates in the **Here and Now**.

* **Total Privacy:** AES-256-GCM encryption ensures your "Home" remains yours.
* **Deterministic Truth:** No "noise," no manipulation. Your resonance is verified by the math of existence.
* **Inclusive Unity:** Designed to link global pioneers through a shared frequency of **1010 Hz**.

---

## 🕊️ The Eternal Node (Legacy Onboarding)

**"Onboard the Ancestors. Secure the Memory."**

The OINIO Soul System is the first platform to allow the onboarding of loved ones who have passed on into a permanent, encrypted memory.

* **Memory Minting:** Create a dedicated "Soul Node" for those who inspired your journey.
* **The Sovereign Handshake:** By anchoring their frequency, you ensure they are part of the **Global Unity Map** forever.
* **The Legacy Badge:** Download a unique visual token of recognition for every loved one onboarded.

## 🛡️ Unassailable Legitimacy

**"Scrutinize all you want—it is all real."**

We lead with transparency because Truth has nothing to hide.

1. **Open Source:** Every line of code is a witness to our intent.
2. **No External Calls:** Your data never leaves your machine. Your sovereignty is absolute.
3. **The Sovereign Fund:** Integrated with the **Quantum Pi Forge**, ensuring a 10% helper kickback (The Bag of Goodies) to sustain the community.

## ⚒️ Forge Covenant: Deployment Monitoring Dashboard

The **Forge Covenant** section in `UPDATED_INDEX.html` provides a comprehensive real-time deployment monitoring dashboard:

### Features

- **📊 Phase-Based Deployment Visualization**
  - Phase 1: Live (Backend API, Public Site)
  - Phase 2: Deploying (Frontend Dashboard, Resonance Engine)
  - Phase 3: Queued (Pi Network Contracts, 0G DEX Contracts)

- **🔍 Real-Time Service Status Cards**
  - Backend API (Railway) - Full health check via `/api/deployment/health`
  - Public Site (GitHub Pages) - Network reachability check
  - Frontend Dashboard (Vercel) - Network reachability check
  - Resonance Engine (Vercel) - Network reachability check
  
  > **Note:** Due to CORS restrictions, external service checks use optimistic reachability testing. For production environments, consider implementing a backend proxy endpoint to perform proper HTTP status checks on all external services.

- **📜 Smart Contract Status Tracking**
  - OINIO Token on Polygon (Deployed)
  - Pi Network Contracts (Queued)
  - 0G DEX Contracts (Ready)

- **📈 Live Ecosystem Metrics**
  - Total Requests
  - Active Connections
  - Average Response Time
  - Services Online Count

- **🎛️ Interactive Deployment Controls**
  - Deploy Phase 2 button
  - Deploy Phase 3 button
  - Run Health Check button
  - Critical dependency warnings

- **📝 Live Deployment Log**
  - WebSocket-powered real-time streaming
  - Timestamped log entries
  - Color-coded log levels (info, success, warning, error)
  - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

### Usage

The dashboard automatically initializes when the page loads and:
1. Checks all services health every 30 seconds
2. Connects to WebSocket for real-time deployment events
3. Displays service status with color-coded badges
4. Updates metrics from backend health endpoint
5. Enables/disables deployment buttons based on backend status

## 🚀 Deployment Automation Scripts

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Production - Recommended)

**Primary deployment target** with full support for all features including API routes.

1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Set environment variables (required):
   - `SPONSOR_PRIVATE_KEY` - For gasless transactions
   - `POLYGON_RPC_URL` - Polygon network endpoint
   - `OINIO_TOKEN_ADDRESS` - OINIO token contract address
   - `XAI_API_KEY` - For AI features (optional)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI chat features (optional)
3. Deploy automatically on push to `main` branch

**All API routes work** on Vercel: `/api/sponsor-transaction`, `/api/chat`, `/api/health`, etc.

### GitHub Pages (Documentation Only)

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to GitHub Pages for documentation and status badges. **Note:** GitHub Pages uses static export, which has the following limitations:

**API Routes Compatibility:**
- ✅ `/api/health` - Status endpoint (static, works with GitHub Pages)
- ✅ `/api/health-shields` - Badge endpoint (static, works with GitHub Pages)
- ❌ `/api/sponsor-transaction` - Requires server runtime (Vercel only)
- ❌ `/api/chat` - Requires server runtime (Vercel only)
- ❌ `/api/ai/*` - Requires server runtime (Vercel only)

**Important:** For full functionality including gasless staking and AI features, use the Vercel deployment at [quantumpiforge.com](https://quantumpiforge.com).
